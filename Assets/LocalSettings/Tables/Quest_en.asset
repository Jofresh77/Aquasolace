    m_Localized: Mixed forests are varied and therefore more resilient than monocultures
      in the forest. In mixed forests you will find species such as the great spotted
      woodpecker and the white-tailed eagle. Reforest the mixed forests with 50 fields.

    m_Localized: Nowhere in Germany do so many pine trees grow as in Brandenburg.
      Although they are not as good at storing water as deciduous and mixed forests,
      coniferous forests also store water and CO2. You will find species such as
      beavers near water. Place an area of coniferous forest fields.

      near woodland.

      that strongly influences their habitat. In your mission to save the water,
      they are your allies. Settle beavers and receive 15 pine trees as a reward.


      Fun
      fact: Beavers have very poor eyesight. They can only see in black and white.
      However, their sense of smell is their most important sense and helps them
      track down enemies and food.'

      flowing waters and pastures. Unfortunately, there are fewer and fewer of these,
      which is why white storks are now an endangered species. Can you reintroduce
      them?\n\nFun fact: The white stork is also known as the \u201Crattling stork\u201D,
      which is due to the loud, characteristic rattling of its beak at the nest."
